# Steam Chat
Steam Chat is a fast, scalable chat server built on [Akka] & [Play Framework].
It uses a modern WebSocket feature with [Play Framework] to provide a realtime experience to users
and it's highly concurrent & scalable thanks to [Akka]'s distributed actor system.

[Play Framework]: https://www.playframework.com

## How To Use

Steam Chat requires a recent version of [Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/get-started).
Then you just need a simple command to lift a server.

```bash
$ activator run
```
